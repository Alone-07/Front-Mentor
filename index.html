            <p>‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
            the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p></div>

               <p>‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
               gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
               junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
               an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p> </div>

       <h2> Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>

      <div class="text-bottom">
       <p>‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
        could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
        100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
